## 📦 Dependencies

| Dependency                                                             | Required    | Purpose                |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| [FiveM Server](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/) build 6116+ | ✅          | Runtime                |
| [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql)                     | ❌ Optional | Persistent ban storage |
| ESX or QBCore                                                          | ❌ Optional | Framework integration  |

> **oxmysql** is disabled by default in `fxmanifest.lua`. To enable persistent MySQL ban storage, uncomment the `@oxmysql/lib/MySQL.lua` line. Without it, bans fall back to FiveM's native KvP automatically — no crash, no data loss.

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1 — Download

**Option A — Git clone**

```bash
cd resources
git clone https://github.com/aminerahik-dev/FiveM-Admin-Menu
```

**Option B — Manual download**

Download the latest `.zip` from [Releases](../../releases), extract it, and place the folder inside your `resources` directory.

Make sure the folder is named exactly: `FiveM-Admin-Menu`

---

### Step 2 — Add to server.cfg

Open your `server.cfg` and add:

```cfg
ensure FiveM-Admin-Menu
```

> ⚠️ Place this **after** your framework resource (`ensure es_extended` or `ensure qb-core`).

---

### Step 3 — Set up permissions

This resource uses FiveM's native ACE permission system. Add the following to `server.cfg`:

**Permission nodes:**

```cfg
# Mod — basic moderation tools
add_ace group.mod  admin_menu.mod  allow

# Admin — full player management
add_ace group.admin  admin_menu.admin  allow

# Superadmin — unrestricted access
add_ace group.superadmin  admin_menu.superadmin  allow
```

**Assign players to groups:**

```cfg
# By license (Rockstar)
add_principal identifier.license:YOUR_LICENSE_HERE  group.superadmin

# By Steam hex
add_principal identifier.steam:110000XXXXXXXXX  group.admin
```

> 💡 **How to find your license identifier:** In-game, type `status` in F8 console. Your identifier appears in the player list.

---

### Step 4 — Configure (optional)

Edit `config.lua` to adjust defaults:

```lua
Config = {}

-- Auto-detected if set to "auto". Options: "auto" | "esx" | "qbcore" | "standalone"
Config.Framework = "auto"

-- Command to open the menu (set to nil to disable)
Config.Command = "adminmenu"

-- Warn thresholds
Config.WarnThresholds = {
    autokick = 3,   -- kick player after X warns
    autoban  = 5    -- ban player after X warns
}

-- Ban reasons (shown as quick-select in UI)
Config.BanReasons = {
    "Cheating / Hacking",
    "Toxic behavior",
    "Bug exploitation",
    "Ban evasion",
    "Other"
}
```

## 🔐 Permission System

Three permission tiers, each inheriting the level below:

| Level          | ACE Node                | Access                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mod**        | `admin_menu.mod`        | Kick, warn, mute, revive, basic tools            |
| **Admin**      | `admin_menu.admin`      | Everything above + ban, give money/items/weapons |
| **Superadmin** | `admin_menu.superadmin` | Full access including records management         |

> Backward compatible with the legacy `admin_menu.open` ACE node.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**All players show as Mod rank regardless of their group**

- Root cause is malformed ACE syntax in `server.cfg` — FiveM's parser is strict about spacing
- Verify your lines match exactly: `add_ace group.admin admin_menu.admin allow` (single space between each token, no tabs)
- After editing `server.cfg`, run `restart FiveM-Admin-Menu` in the server console — a full server restart is not required
- Use `test_ace [player_id] admin_menu.superadmin` in the server console to confirm the correct node resolves

**Menu doesn't open**

- Confirm `ensure FiveM-Admin-Menu` is in `server.cfg`
- Check F8 console for errors on resource start
- Verify your ACE node is correctly assigned (`add_principal` line matches your identifier)

**Permission denied / menu opens but actions are blocked**

- Make sure the correct ACE node is assigned (`admin_menu.mod`, `.admin`, or `.superadmin`)
- Run `test_ace [player_id] admin_menu.admin` in the server console to verify ACE is active

**Bans not persisting after server restart**

- Without `oxmysql`: bans use KvP — data persists per server instance but may not survive full wipes
- With `oxmysql`: ensure the resource starts before `fivem-admin-menu` and the DB connection is healthy

**Spectate crashes or kicks me**

- This is a known FiveM issue when spectating players with unsynced network objects
- The resource includes a network validation guard — if it still occurs, the target player may have a bad sync state; try spectating someone else first

**`NetworkGetEntityFromNetworkId` warning in console**

- Non-critical. Happens when a player's vehicle netId is 0 (not yet spawned/synced). Guarded in the code — safe to ignore.
